          Simple. To encourage fitness and enjoyment of our mountains, among North Country residents and our friends from afar— and to do it in a low-key, fun way on a schedule that works for you. This is not a race.

          <li>
            Start with one hand on the kiosk at Appalachia. Set a stop watch to zero and start it running!
          </li>
          <li>
            Run up Valley Way to the junction with Brookside. Turn left on Brookside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Run Brookside to Watson Path, turn right on Watson Path. Watch for this turn very closely. It comes in at a shallow angle and is easy to miss!
          </li>
          <li>
            Run Watson Path, cross Valley Way, and run the faint, short section of Watson Path to Scar Trail. Be careful to stay on the trail here. The tread way is faint for about 200 yards. Continue straight ahead on Scar Trail.
          </li>
          <li>
            Run Scar Trail to Air Line, turn left on Air Line.

          <li>
            Run Gulfside to Thunderstorm Junction. Turn left onto Lowe's Path.
          </li>
          <li>
            Run Lowe's Path to the summit of Adams.
          </li>
          <li>
            Touch the sign. Turn off your stop watch.

            Whatever your result is...congratulations!

        <ol>
          <li>
            Nothing is more important than your personal safety, and only you are responsible for your own safety. You are on your own in the mountains. Act with common sense. If you are uncertain of your ability, physical condition, or the weather, do not attempt the Mount Adams Challenge.
          </li>
          <li>
            Run with respect and good intention. Follow Leave No Trace’s <a href="https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles" target="_blank">seven principles</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be honest with yourself and others. No cheating!
          </li>
          <li>
            Have fun and be supportive of others who are trying the challenge.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are trying for a fastest-known time for the challenge, please share a GPS log with us.
